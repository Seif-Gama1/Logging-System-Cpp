File: logging/src/LogFormatter.cpp

Purpose
- (Commented) explicit-instantiation / reference file for template LogFormatter. The real formatter is header-only.

Notes
- The file contains commented-out code and serves as a reminder that LogFormatter is designed to be used as a header-only template.
- No runtime behavior; keep the template implementations in `LogFormatter.hpp`.
